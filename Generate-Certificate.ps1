.SYNOPSIS
    This script/function requests and receives a New Certificate from your Windows-based Issuing Certificate Authority.

    When used in conjunction with the Generate-CertTemplate.ps1 script/function, all needs can be satisfied.
    (See: https://github.com/pldmgg/misc-powershell/blob/master/Generate-CertTemplate.ps1)

    This can be run as a script by uncommenting the very last line calling the Generate-Certificate function, or by 
    simply loading the entire function into your current PowerShell shell and then calling it.

    IMPORTANT NOTE 1: By running the function without any parameters, the user will be walked through several prompts. 
    This is the recommended way to use this function until the user feels comfortable with parameters mentioned below.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function/script is split into the following sections (ctl-f to jump to each of these sections)
    - Libraries and Helper Functions (~Lines 298-1395)
    - Initial Variable Definition and Validation (~Lines 1397-1760)
    - Writing the Certificate Request Config File (~Lines 1762-2169)
    - Generate Certificate Request and Submit to Issuing Certificate Authority (~Lines 2172-2284)

    OUTPUTS
    All outputs are written to the $CertGenWorking directory specified by the user.

    ALWAYS GENERATED
    The following outputs are ALWAYS generated by this function/script, regardless of optional parameters: 
        - A Certificate Request Configuration File (with .inf file extension) - 
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $CertificateRequestConfigFile
        - A Certificate Request File (with .csr file extenstion) - 
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $CertificateRequestFile
        - A Public Certificate with the New Certificate Name (NewCertificate_$CertificateCN_[Timestamp].cer) - 
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $CertFileOut
            NOTE: This file is not explicitly generated by the script. Rather, it is received from the Issuing Certificate Authority after 
            the Certificate Request is submitted and accepted by the Issuing Certificate Authority. 
            NOTE: If you choose to use Win32 OpenSSL to extract certs/keys from the .pfx file (see below), this file should have SIMILAR CONTENT
            to the file $PublicKeySansChainOutFile. To clarify, $PublicKeySansChainOutFile does NOT have what appear to be extraneous newlines, 
            but $CertFileOut DOES. Even though $CertFileOut has what appear to be extraneous newlines, Microsoft Crypto Shell Extensions will 
            be able to read both files as if they were the same. However, Linux machines will need to use $PublicKeySansChainOutFile (Also, the 
            file extension for $PublicKeySansChainOutFile can safely be changed from .cer to .pem without issue)
    
    GENERATED WHEN $MachineKeySet = "FALSE"
    The following outputs are ONLY generated by this function/script when $MachineKeySet = "FALSE" (this is its default setting)
        - A .pfx File Containing the Entire Public Certificate Chain AS WELL AS the Private Key of your New Certificate (with .pfx file extension) - 
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $PFXFileOut
            NOTE: The Private Key must be marked as exportable in your Certificate Request Configuration File in order for the .pfx file to
            contain the private key. This is controlled by the parameter $PrivateKeyExportableValue = "TRUE". The Private Key is marked as 
            exportable by default.
    
    GENERATED WHEN $RequestViaWebEnrollment = "No"
    The following outputs are ONLY generated by this function/script when $RequestViaWebEnrollment = "No" (this is its default setting)
    (NOTE: Under this scenario, the workstation running the script must be part of the same domain as the Issuing Certificate Authority):
        - A Certificate Request Response File (with .rsp file extension) 
            NOTE: This file is not explicitly generated by the script. Rather, it is received from the Issuing Certificate Authority after 
            the Certificate Request is submitted
        - A Certificate Chain File (with .p7b file extension) -
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $CertificateChainOut
            NOTE: This file is not explicitly generated by the script. Rather, it is received from the Issuing Certificate Authority after 
            the Certificate Request is submitted and accepted by the Issuing Certificate Authority
            NOTE: This file contains the entire chain of public certificates, from the requested certificate, up to the Root CA
            WARNING: In order to parse the public certificates for each entity up the chain, you MUST use the Crypto Shell Extensions GUI,
            otherwise, if you look at this content with a text editor, it appears as only one (1) public certificate.  Use the OpenSSL
            Certificate Chain File ($AllPublicKeysInChainOut) optional output in order to view a text file that parses each entity's public certificate.
    
    GENERATED WHEN $RequestViaWebEnrollment = "Yes"
    The following outputs are ONLY generated by this function/script when $RequestViaWebEnrollment = "Yes"
    (NOTE: Under this scenario, the workstation running the script is sending a web request to the ADCS Web Enrollment website):
        - An File Containing the HTTP Response From the ADCS Web Enrollment Site (with .txt file extension) - 
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $CertADCSWebResponse
    
    GENERATED WHEN $UseOpenSSL = "Yes"
    The following outputs are ONLY generated by this function/script when $UseOpenSSL = "Yes"
    (WARNING: This creates a Dependency on a third party Win32 OpenSSL binary that can be found here: https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/
    For more information, see the DEPENDENCIES Section below)
        - A Certificate Chain File (ending with "all_public_keys_in_chain.pem") -
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $AllPublicKeysInChainOut
            NOTE: This optional parameter differs from the aforementioned .p7b certificate chain output in that it actually parses
            each entity's public certificate in a way that is viewable in a text editor.
        - EACH Public Certificate in the Certificate Chain File (file name like [Certificate CN]_Public_Cert.cer)
            - A Public Certificate with the New Certificate Name ($CertificateCN_Public_Cert.cer) -
                RELEVANT PARAMETER: $PublicKeySansChainOutFile
                NOTE: This file should have SIMILAR CONTENT to $CertFileOut referenced earlier. To clarify, $PublicKeySansChainOutFile does NOT have
                what appear to be extraneous newlines, but $CertFileOut DOES. Even though $CertFileOut has what appear to be extraneous newlines, Microsoft Crypto Shell Extensions will 
                be able to read both files as if they were the same. However, Linux machines will need to use $PublicKeySansChainOutFile (Also, the 
                file extension for $PublicKeySansChainOutFile can safely be changed from .cer to .pem without issue)
            - Additional Public Certificates in Chain including [Subordinate CA CN]_Public_Cert.cer and [Root CA CN]_Public_Cert.cer
        - A Password Protected Private Key file (ending with "protected_private_key.pem") -
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $ProtectedPrivateKeyOut
            NOTE: This is the New Certificate's Private Key that is protected by a password defined by the $PFXPwdAsSecureString parameter.

    GENERATED WHEN $UseOpenSSL = "Yes" AND $StripPrivateKeyOfPassword = "Yes"
        - An Unprotected Private Key File (ends with unprotected_private_key.key) -
            RELEVANT PARAMETER: $UnProtectedPrivateKeyOut

.PARAMETERS
    IMPORTANT NOTE 2: Default values for ALL parameters are already provided, and running the Generate-Certificate script/
    function will generate a New Certificate using these default values, however, the resulting Certificate
    may not satisfy all of your needs depending on your circumstances.

    Please review the explanation for each of the variables/parameters that can/should be changed below.

    1) $CertGenWorking - Full path to directory that all output files will be written to. Using a network location is fine, but 
    not recommended from a security standpoint.

    2) $BasisTemplate - Either the CN or the displayName of the Certificate Template that you are basing this New Certificate on.

    3) $CertificateCN - The name that you would like to give the New Certificate. This name will appear in the following 
    locations:
        - "FriendlyName" field of the Certificate Request
        - "Friendly name" field the New Certificate itself
        - "Friendly Name" field when viewing the New Certificate in the Local Certificate Store
        - "Subject" field of the Certificate Request
        - "Subject" field on the New Certificate itself
        - "Issued To" field when viewing the New Certificate in the Local Certificate Store

    4) $CertificateRequestConfigFile - Certificate Request configuration file to be submitted to the Issuing Certificate 
    Authority. File extension is .inf.

    5) $CertificateRequestFile - Conversion of $CertificateRequestConfigFile via certreq to .csr file to be submitted to the 
    Issuing Certificate Authority. File extension is .csr.

    6) $CertFileOut - The New Public Certificate received from the Issuing Certificate Authority. File extension is .cer

    7) $CertificateChainOut - The Chain of Publiec Certificates from the New Public Certificate up to the Root Certificate 
    Authority. File extension is .p7b.

    # NOTE: File extension will be .p7b even if format is PKCS10 (which should have extension .p10). This is to ensure that 
    Microsoft Crypto Shell Extensions recognizes the file. (Some systems do not have .p10 associated with Crypto Shell Extensions 
    by default, leading to confusion). 

    8) $PFXFileOut - File containing both Public AND Private Keys for the New Certificate. File extension is .pfx

    9) $PFXPwdAsSecureString - A Plaintext Password OR a Secure String object. (Plaintext will be converted to a Secure String by the script).
    In order to export a .pfx file from the Local Certificate Store, a password must be supplied (or permissions based on user accounts 
    must be configured beforehand, but this is outside the scope of this script). 
    ***IMPORTANT*** This same password is applied to $ProtectedPrivateKeyOut if $UseOpenSSL = "Yes"
    ***IMPORTANT*** To avoid providing this password in plaintext on the command line, recommend using Generate-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1 and 
    Decrypt-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1 to pass this parameter. See:
    https://github.com/pldmgg/misc-powershell/blob/master/Generate-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1
    https://github.com/pldmgg/misc-powershell/blob/master/Decrypt-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1

    10) $RequestViaWebEnrollment - If this parameter is set to "No", then PowerShell cmdlets will be used that assume that the workstation 
    running this script is also joined to the same domain as the Issuing Certificate Authority. If this parameter is set to "Yes", then
    the Invoke-WebRequest will be used to POST data to the ADCS Web Enrollment website specified by $ADCSWebEnrollmentURL (see below).

    11) $ADCSWebEnrollmentURL - URL of ADCS Web Enrollment website. Example: https://pki.test.lab/certsrv

    12) $ADCSWebAuthType - The IIS Web Server hosting the ADCS Web Enrollment site can be configured to use Windows Authentication, Basic
    Authentication, or both. Specify either "Windows" or "Basic" for this parameter.

    13) $ADCSWebAuthUserName - A username with permission to access the ADCS Web Enrollment site. If $ADCSWebAuthType = "Basic", then
    INCLUDE the domain prefix as part of the username. Example: test2\testadmin . If $ADCSWebAuthType = "Windows", then DO NOT INCLUDE
    the domain prefix as part of the username. Example: testadmin
    (NOTE: If you mix up the above username formatting, then the script will figure it out. This is more of an FYI.)

    14) $ADCSWebAuthPass - A Plaintext Password OR a Secure String object. (Plaintext will be converted to a Secure String by the script).
    If this parameter is left blank, the user will be prompted for secure input. If using this script as part of a larger automated process, 
    use a wrapper function to pass this parameter securely (this is outside the scope of this script).
    ***IMPORTANT*** To avoid providing this password in plaintext on the command line, recommend using Generate-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1 and 
    Decrypt-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1 to pass this parameter. See:
    https://github.com/pldmgg/misc-powershell/blob/master/Generate-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1
    https://github.com/pldmgg/misc-powershell/blob/master/Decrypt-EncryptedPwdFile.ps1

    33) $MachineKeySet - Valid values are "TRUE" and "FALSE". Default value is "FALSE". If you would like the private key exported, use "FALSE". 
    If you are creating this certificate to be used in the User's security context (like for a developer to sign their code), enter "FALSE". 
    If you are using this certificate for a service that runs in the Computer's security context (such as a Web Server, Domain Controller, etc) and
    DO NOT need the Private Key exported use "TRUE".
    See: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736326(v=ws.10).aspx

    34) $SecureEmail - Valid values are "Yes" and "No". If the New Certificate is going to be used to digitally sign and/or encrypt emails, this parameter should be set to "Yes"

    to "FALSE", then $UserProtected can be set to "Yes" or "No". 

    If set to "Yes", a CryptoAPI password window is displayed when the key is generated during the certificate request 
    build process. You can optionally protect the key with a password in the window or choose to display only a window when the 
    key is used within an application. Once the key is protected with a password, you must enter this password every time the key 
    is accessed.
